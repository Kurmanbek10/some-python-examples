# for loop with if, else, elif
# fizzbuzz.py

#Print numbers from 1 to 100 but: 'range(1,101)'
# for numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
# for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
# for multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

# You need to use combination of for loop + if,elif,else statement,
# you need to use modulo %.
